# BourdainTravels
Calculating how far Anthony Bourdain traveled during his television series

# Data for Makeover Monday Week 33
Week 33's Makeover Monday includes data on where Anthony Bourdain traveled while he was filming his fou television serieses. With a little coding, we can determine *how far* he travelled while he was filming. However, there are a few assumptions we have to make:

* Anthony Bourdain filmed his shows in the same order that they aired.
* Anthony Bourdain did not film multiple shows in the same location. He wouldn't be able to film two shows while in Japan, and post them in any order that isn't connesctive.

The code can be found in the jupyter notebook file BoudainDistance.
